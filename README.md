# Start-Up-Success-Prediction
Using Machine Learning to help VC Funds predict the success of Start-Ups

More and more start-Ups are evolving and emerging in todays competitive environment. 
From all of these companies, some go public (IPO) or are merged and acquired (M&A), while many others disappear.  
What defines the difference between success and failure? Which leads us to the question, how can we predict the success of companies?.

In this project, given some key features of a company, we want to predict the probability of its success. 

More specifically, we will discuss:

* Select the most practical features generally used for company evaluation.

* Find quality relevant data (Using crunch base)

* Clean and validate data into a representable format

* Examine input features of two types: text features (such as ‘industry category,’ or ‘location’) and numerical features (such as ’capital raised’ or ‘net-profit’)

* Use Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and K Nearest Neighbors to train our models.

* Finally, we will statistically analyse each model's performance ROC curves to find the best model.
